# ondewo-vtsi-client-cpp - Makefile
#
# The ONDEWO VTSI (Virtual Telephony Server Interface) gRPC client library for C++.
#
# There is no hand-written client code in this repository: everything under api/ is
# generated from the .proto files of the ondewo-vtsi-api submodule by the
# ondewo-cpp-proto-compiler docker image (the ondewo-proto-compiler submodule), which
# also packages the result as a consumable CMake package.
#
# Quick start:
#   make help                    # list every documented target
#   make makefile_chapters       # list the section headers below
#   make build                   # submodules -> compiler image -> stubs -> library
#   make test                    # verify the generated code and consume the CMake package
#   make publish_dry_run         # build the release archive and consume it - no credentials
#
# Versioning: ONDEWO_VTSI_VERSION (below) is the single source of truth and MUST
# match the ONDEWO VTSI API in major and minor version.
#
# Overriding variables: pass on the command line, e.g. `make build LIBRARY_NAME=my_client`,
# or export in the environment. Credentials (GITHUB_GH_TOKEN) are only ever read at runtime
# and must never be committed.
# =====================================================================================

# ---------------- BEFORE RELEASE ----------------
# 1 - Update Version Number
# 2 - Update RELEASE.md
# 3 - make build
# -------------- Release Process Steps --------------
# 1 - Get Credentials from devops-accounts repo
# 2 - Create Release Branch and push
# 3 - Create Release Tag and push
# 4 - GitHub Release
# 5 - Attach the release archive to the GitHub Release (there is no C++ package registry)

# the extracted archive is what the generated *-config.cmake files exist for.
# The archive is a BINARY artifact (static archive + headers + CMake package files), so the name
